# JSON Data Encryptor
The JSON Data Encryptor is a powerful and easy-to-use JavaScript tool designed for secure encryption and decryption of JSON data in the browser. Leveraging the Web Crypto API, it provides strong encryption using AES-CBC with 256-bit keys. This project ensures your sensitive information remains secure, whether stored locally or transmitted over the internet.

## Features
- **Strong Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256-CBC for high-level security.
- **Manual Key Handling**: Supports manual keys for encryption and decryption, allowing for a flexible and secure approach to key management.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly in modern web browsers, leveraging the Web Crypto API.
- **JSON Support**: Specifically tailored for handling JSON data, making it ideal for web applications that need to secure user data.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser that supports the Web Crypto API.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and handling JSON data.
